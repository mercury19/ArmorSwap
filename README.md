This is NOT complete!

There are additional files and folders that need to be created within the for-loops in ArmorSwap.py, but the overall shape is basically complete.

There are a lot of "null" values in ArmorSets.json that will prevent the file from being processed properly, so the code WILL NOT RUN in its current state.

I need to edit these values by hand via a very tedious process. I can't focuse well enough to do it all in one sitting, so I'm bouncing back and forth between

writing the code and finishing the data.
