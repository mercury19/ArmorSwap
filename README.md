This is NOT complete!

Most additonal folder and file creation is implemented, or has an easy implementation ready to go, except some image files need to be added to the copy process after I create/edit them, but thag can easily be added to the current process.

There are a lot of "null" values in ArmorSets.json that will prevent the file from being processed properly, so the code WILL NOT RUN in its current state.

I need to edit these values by hand via a very tedious process. I can't focuse well enough to do it all in one sitting, so I'm bouncing back and forth between writing the code and finishing the data.

I've shifted from a named tuple to proper classes in order to have class methods and more complex attributes.
